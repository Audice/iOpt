Introduction
============

iOpt is an open source intelligent optimization framework. It is designed to select the optimal (in a given metric) parameter values for complex objects and processes, for example, artificial intelligence and machine learning methods, as well as heuristic optimization methods.

The framework allows one to tune the parameters of models and methods used in applied research in various scientific fields.

The iOpt framework is developed in Python. To use it, you need to have Python 3.8 or later installed.

The iOpt source code is available at https://github.com/aimclub/iOpt.
