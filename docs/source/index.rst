iOpt is an open source framework for automatic selection of parameter values both for mathematical models of complex industrial processes and for AI and ML methods used in industry. The framework is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

Key features of the framework
_____________________________

- Automatic selection of parameter values both for mathematical models and for AI and ML methods used in industry.
- Intelligent control of the process of choosing the optimal parameters for industrial applications.
- Integration with external artificial intelligence and machine learning libraries or frameworks as well as applied models.
- Automation of the preliminary analysis of the models under study, e.g., by identifying different types of model dependencies on different groups of parameters.
- Visualization of the process of choosing optimal parameters.
